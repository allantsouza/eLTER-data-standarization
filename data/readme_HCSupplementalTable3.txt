Map of Life utilizes Humboldt Core to describe all of the ingested local inventories that are currently available. Our data curators utilize a best practices guide to do so, located here. We will soon further provide tools to filter inventories more effectively according to scope, method or completeness criteria. The work to standardize reporting strongly facilitates such filtered and faceted searching.

The developers of Map of Life want to make it as easy as possible for you to utilize this standard in your own reporting, and therefore we have provided an excel spreadsheetthat has all the terms and their brief definitions. We have some examples of using Humboldt Core, again in excel format, utilizing exemplar published inventories, also attached.
